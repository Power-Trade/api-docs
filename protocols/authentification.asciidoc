[[Authentication]]
=== Authentication

PowerTrade requires clients to use API keys in order to access the APIs.

There are two components to an API key: the key itself and the so-called “secret”. Both are needed in order to authenticate with the API and in order to use the API.

The “secret” is used to sign messages sent to the platform’s backend.
The API key serves as a username. API keys can be obtained here <link>.

The detailes about signing procedure can be found below.
