=== Cycles, Channels and Streams

As discussed previously, a cycle represents a logical division of time within a trading session. A cycle starts as soon as the previous one ends, e.g. as shown on the diagram of <<market_data_protocol, Market Data Protocol>>. Cycles currently last one hour in the production platform. Cycles, Channels and Streams are closely related as follows. When a new cycle starts, the platform notifies the client with a new channel ID. The client must use the new channel ID to request a new stream from the platform.

As described in earlier sections, streams are essentially a set of events, each event representing an action taken on objects within the service they represent and resulting in a change of the state of the service. Streams are associated with channels. In order for the client to start receiving a stream, the channel ID must be provided to the backend.
